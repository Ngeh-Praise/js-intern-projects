 # JS Intern Projects

Welcome!  
This repository contains three small JavaScript projects completed as part of my ongoing internship at **FastWeb**. Each project is structured in its own folder and demonstrates core frontend development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

 ## Projects Overview

 # 1. Expense Tracker

A simple finance tracker that allows a user to:

- Add an expense name and amount
- See the expense listed in real time
- Automatically calculate the total
- Delete individual expenses
- Clear all expenses
- Highlight expenses above a threshold

This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic application logic using JavaScript.

# 2. Student Grade UI

A tool for grading student scores:

- Enter a student name and score (0–100)
- Automatically calculate the grade (A, B, C, D, F)
- Display the result, color-coded by grade
- Maintain a list of all submitted students

This project highlights input validation, conditional logic, lists, and dynamic UI updates.

# 3. Theme Switcher

A UI widget that allows a user to change the overall theme of the page:

- Light Mode
- Dark Mode
- Blue Mode
- Smooth transition between themes
- Active button highlighting

This project reinforces class manipulation, styling, and UI transitions.
